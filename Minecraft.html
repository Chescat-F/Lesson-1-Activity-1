                <p>
                    Minecraft is a 3D sandbox adventure game developed by Mojang Studios where players can interact with a fully
                    customizable three-dimensional world made of blocks and entities. Its diverse gameplay options allow players to choose
                    the way they play, creating countless possibilities.
                    
                    There are three actively maintained editions of Minecraft: Java Edition (Windows, macOS, Linux); Bedrock Edition
                    (Windows, mobile, and consoles); and Minecraft Education (for educational settings). There is also a localized release
                    of the game for mainland China, referred to as China Edition.
